# Predictive Analysis of Boston Housing Data

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a basic predictive analysis using the **Boston Housing dataset**. The aim is to understand how different factors related to neighborhoods and housing characteristics affect the **median value of houses**.

## About the Dataset
The Boston Housing dataset contains information about housing and neighborhood characteristics in Boston suburbs.

- **Response Variable:**  
  - `MEDV` – Median value of owner-occupied homes

- **Predictor Variables:**  
  - Crime rate  
  - Average number of rooms  
  - Distance to employment centers  
  - Property tax rate  
  - Pupil–teacher ratio  
  - Other socioeconomic and environmental variables

## What This Project Covers
- Understanding the dataset and its variables
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends
- Visual analysis using boxplots and scatterplots
- Identification and discussion of outliers
- Building predictive models using regression techniques
- Interpreting results in both technical and simple language

## Tools Used
